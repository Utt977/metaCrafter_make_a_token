# MyToken Contract

## Project Title
MyToken Contract - A Basic Token Contract for Minting and Burning Tokens

## Description
This contract provides a basic implementation of a token contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the minting and burning of tokens. The contract includes functionalities to store token details, such as the token name, abbreviation, and total supply. It also maintains a mapping of addresses to token balances. The `mint` function increases the total supply and assigns tokens to a specified address, while the `burn` function decreases the total supply and deducts tokens from a specified address, subject to certain conditions.

## Getting Started

### Installing
To use this contract, you need to have a compatible Ethereum development environment set up. Here are the installation steps:

1. Install an Ethereum development framework such as Truffle or Hardhat.
2. Set up a local Ethereum development network or connect to a testnet/mainnet.

### Executing Program
To run the program and interact with the contract, follow these steps:

1. Download the source code of the contract to your local environment.
2. Compile the contract using the appropriate command in your Ethereum development framework.
3. Deploy the compiled contract to your Ethereum network of choice.
4. Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using the available functions.

### Step-by-step Bullets
1. Install Ethereum development framework (e.g., Truffle or Hardhat).
2. Set up a local Ethereum development network or connect to a testnet/mainnet.
3. Download the contract source code.
4. Compile the contract using the Ethereum development framework's command.
5. Deploy the compiled contract to your Ethereum network.
6. Interact with the contract using the available functions.

## How to Use
To use this contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the `MyToken` contract on a compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
2. Once deployed, you can access the public variables:
   - `tokenName`: The name of the token.
   - `tokenAbbrv`: The abbreviation or symbol of the token.
   - `totalSupply`: The total supply of tokens.
3. You can interact with the contract using the following functions:
   - `mint`: Call this function to mint new tokens. Provide the address where the tokens will be assigned (`_address`) and the amount of tokens to mint (`_value`).
   - `burn`: Call this function to burn tokens. Provide the address from where the tokens will be deducted (`_address`) and the amount of tokens to burn (`_value`).
   Note: The `burn` function will only succeed if the balance of the `_address` is greater than or equal to the `_value`.
4. You can query token balances using the `balances` mapping. Access the balance of a specific address by providing the address as the key.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use this contract:

```solidity
// Deploy the MyToken contract
MyToken myToken = new MyToken();

// Mint 100 tokens to a specific address
address recipient = 0x1234567890abcdef;
uint amount = 100;
myToken.mint(recipient, amount);

// Burn 50 tokens from the recipient's address
myToken.burn(recipient, 50);

// Check the balance of the recipient's address
uint balance = myToken.balances(recipient);
```

In this example, we deploy the contract, mint 100 tokens to a recipient, burn 50 tokens from the recipient's address, and finally, check the remaining balance of the recipient's address.

Remember to have a compatible Ethereum development environment set up and test the contract thoroughly before deploying it to the mainnet.
